# 2. LaTeX Environment Options

## 2.1. LaTeX Environment Choices

Based on our experience, we recommend two primary approaches for working with LaTeX for your resume projects. Local installations of LaTeX on Windows and WSL can be problematic and time-consuming, so we recommend these more reliable options:

### 2.1.1. Docker-Based LaTeX Environment

- **Full Capabilities:** Docker-based LaTeX provides **complete functionality** equivalent to traditional installations
- **Environment Control:** Offers **full control** over package installation and configuration
- **Consistency:** Ensures **identical behavior** across different machines and operating systems
- **Integration:** Works seamlessly with **local development tools** like Cursor Copilot
- **Collaboration:** Can be paired with **GitHub workflows** for version control and team collaboration
- **Isolation:** Keeps LaTeX environment **separate from host system**, preventing conflicts
- **Portability:** Easy to replicate environment on different machines without lengthy setup

**Best For:** Users who need AI assistance with Cursor Copilot, need offline capabilities, or prefer working in their own development environment.

### 2.1.2. Overleaf Platform

- **Accessibility:** **Web-based interface** accessible from any device with internet connection
- **Zero Setup:** Eliminates need for local installation or configuration
- **Built-in Collaboration:** Supports **real-time editing** with multiple users simultaneously
- **User-Friendly:** Designed with **intuitive interface** for both beginners and advanced users
- **Templates:** Provides extensive library of pre-designed templates
- **Limited Offline Use:** Requires internet connection for most functionality

**Best For:** Users who prioritize ease of use, frequent collaboration, or need to access documents from multiple devices without setup.

## 2.2. Recommended Docker Image

Our repository uses the **qdm12/latexdevcontainer** Docker image (`ghcr.io/qdm12/latexdevcontainer:latest-full`), specifically configured for Cursor Copilot integration. This image was chosen for several important reasons:

### 2.2.1. Why We Chose This Image

- **Complete TeXLive Distribution:** Includes the full TeX Live 2023 distribution with all LaTeX packages
- **Optimized for Dev Containers:** Built specifically for VS Code/Cursor dev container workflows
- **Pre-configured LaTeX Workshop:** Comes with settings for the LaTeX Workshop extension
- **Auto-Updates:** Updates all TeX packages on container startup
- **Lightweight Base:** Built on Alpine Linux for faster startup times
- **Regular Maintenance:** Actively maintained with frequent updates

### 2.2.2. How to Use the Docker Image

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
   - Install [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) IDE
   - Install the [Remote - Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension

2. **Getting Started:**
   - Clone this repository
   - Open it in Cursor
   - When prompted, select "Reopen in Container" (or use the Command Palette: `Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` â†’ `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container`)
   - The container will build automatically with all LaTeX packages installed

3. **Using the Environment:**
   - Edit .tex files directly in Cursor
   - Save to trigger automatic compilation (configured in LaTeX Workshop)
   - View the PDF in the built-in tab viewer
   - Use Cursor AI (`Ctrl+K` or `Cmd+K`) for LaTeX assistance

This approach removes all the headaches of local LaTeX installation while providing a full-featured environment that works perfectly with AI assistance.

### 2.2.3. Technical Details

Our container setup includes:
- **LaTeX Workshop** extension for compilation and preview
- **LaTeX Utilities** for enhanced LaTeX editing
- **LTeX** for grammar checking in LaTeX documents
- **Code Spell Checker** for spell checking
- **Copilot** integration for AI assistance

The container is configured to:
- Automatically build LaTeX documents on save
- Clean auxiliary files after successful builds
- Use SyncTeX for synchronized PDF viewing
- Update all TeX packages on container startup

You can see the full configuration in the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file.

### 2.2.4. Image Size and Performance Considerations

The Docker image (`ghcr.io/qdm12/latexdevcontainer:latest-full`) is large due to the comprehensive nature of the full TeX Live distribution:

- **Download size:** Approximately 4-5 GB
- **Installed size:** Approximately 7-9 GB on disk

This is normal for a complete LaTeX environment that includes thousands of packages, fonts, and documentation. Some key points to understand:

- The image is only downloaded once and cached locally by Docker
- Subsequent project openings reuse the cached image without re-downloading
- The container is created when you open the project and removed when you close your editor
- Docker only downloads updates when the base image changes

If you're concerned about disk space, smaller alternatives like `ghcr.io/qdm12/latexdevcontainer:latest-basic` (around 2-3 GB) are available, but they include fewer LaTeX packages and may not support all advanced resume templates.

## 2.3. Best LaTeX Extension for VS Code

Use the **[LaTeX Workshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop)** extension:

### 2.3.1. Extension Info:

- **Name:** LaTeX Workshop
- **ID:** `James-Yu.latex-workshop`
- **Marketplace:** [View on VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop)

### 2.3.2. Features:

- Live PDF preview with sync (forward/inverse search)
- Auto build on save
- Syntax highlighting and snippet support
- IntelliSense for citations, labels, and refs
- Works with both Windows and WSL backends

# 3. Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)

## 3.1. What is an ATS?

An **Applicant Tracking System (ATS)** is software that employers use to manage job applications and screen candidates. Key facts:

- **95%+ of Fortune 500 companies** use ATS software
- ATS filters out **75% of resumes** before a human sees them
- Average corporate job posting receives **250+ applications**
- Most resumes are reviewed for only **6-7 seconds** by humans (if they pass ATS)

Think of an ATS as a **digital gatekeeper** that determines if your resume reaches human reviewers.

## 3.2. How ATS Systems Process Resumes

1. **Resume Parsing**: ATS extracts text from your document and categorizes information into predefined fields (name, work history, education, skills).
2. **Keyword Matching**: Compares your resume against job description keywords and qualification requirements.
3. **Ranking**: Assigns scores to candidates based on matching criteria.
4. **Database Storage**: Saves your resume and information in searchable format.
5. **Filtering**: Screens out candidates who don't meet minimum requirements.

## 3.3. Key Strategies for ATS Optimization

| Strategy                            | Implementation                                                             |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Match the Job Description** | Tailor resume keywords to match each specific job posting                  |
| **Use Standard Sections**     | Include clearly labeled sections for Experience, Skills, Education         |
| **Include Hard Skills**       | List relevant technical skills, certifications, and software proficiencies |
| **Format Simply**             | Use clean, standard fonts and straightforward layouts                      |
| **Keyword Placement**         | Include key terms in work experience (not just skills section)             |

# 4. Best Examples

- [rover-resume](https://github.com/subidit/rover-resume)
- [GitHub Search: Popular LaTeX Resumes](https://github.com/search?q=stars%3A%3E10+forks%3A%3E10+language%3ATeX+resume&type=repositories&ref=advsearch&s=stars&o=desc)

# 5. Resume Font Guide

## 5.1. Why Inter + Montserrat?
- **Modern look** ideal for startups and tech companies
- **Highly readable** on screen and in print
- **ATS-compliant** (friendly for resume scanners)
- **Free and open-source** via Google Fonts:
  - [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter)
  - [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat)

---

## 5.2. Avoid These for Resumes
- **Times New Roman** â€“ Overused and outdated
- **Comic Sans / Papyrus** â€“ Not professional
- **Fancy display fonts** â€“ Bad for ATS, hard to read

---

## 5.3. Modern Fonts for Tech & Startups
Perfect for innovation-driven, digital-first environments.

| Font              | Style       | Why It's Great                                  |
|-------------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Roboto**        | Sans-serif  | Clean, modern, used in Android & Google tools   |
| **Lato**          | Sans-serif  | Friendly, sleek, and balanced                   |
| **Inter**         | Sans-serif  | Optimized for digital UI, open and readable     |
| **Montserrat**    | Sans-serif  | Bold, geometric, stylish for headers            |
| **Source Sans Pro**| Sans-serif | Adobe-designed, clean and modern                |

**Tips:**
- Use **Inter** or **Roboto** for body, **Montserrat** or **Lato** for headers  
- Line spacing: **1.25â€“1.5**  
- Margins: **0.5â€“0.75 inch**  
- Keep layout clean and ATS-friendly

---

## 5.4. Classic & Safe Resume Fonts
Great for general, traditional, or academic roles.

| Font         | Style       | Why Use It                          |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Calibri**  | Sans-serif  | Microsoft default, modern, ATS-safe |
| **Helvetica**| Sans-serif  | Clean, professional, widely respected |
| **Georgia**  | Serif       | Screen-friendly, elegant classic    |
| **Cambria**  | Serif       | Print-optimized, balanced            |
| **Garamond** | Serif       | Elegant and traditional (great for CVs) |

**Tips:**
- Font size: **10â€“12 pt** body, **12â€“14 pt** headers  
- Stick to one font for consistency  
- Avoid outdated or playful fonts like Comic Sans or Times New Roman
