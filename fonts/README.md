# Google Fonts
The direct links to both fonts on Google Fonts:

- ðŸ”¤ **Inter**: [https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter)
- ðŸ”¤ **Montserrat**: [https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat)

You can preview, customize weights, and download them directly from those pages. Let me know if you want help applying them to a resume template in Google Docs or LaTeX.
